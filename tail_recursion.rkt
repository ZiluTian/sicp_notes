;Recursive procedure can have iterative process or recursive process
;
;For languages where interpretation of any recursive procedures consumes
;an amount of memory that grows with the number of procedure calls,
;iterative processes have special loop constructs
;
;Tail-recursive: An implementation such that any iterative process consumes
;constant space, even if described by a recursive procedure

; How many different ways can we make change of 1,
